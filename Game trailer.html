 <h1  style="color: antiquewhite;" align="center">Assassin's Creed Mirage</h1>
 <p  style="color: antiquewhite;" align="center">Assassin's Creed Mirage is an upcoming action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux and published by Ubisoft. It will be the thirteenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Principally set in 9th-century Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age, the game will follow Basim Ibn Ishaq (a character first introduced in Valhalla) and his transition from street thief to fully-fledged member of the Assassin Brotherhood, who fight for peace and liberty, against the Templar Order, who desire peace through control.[b] The game has been described as a return to the series' roots, with a bigger focus on linear storytelling and stealth gameplay than more recent installments, which primarily focused on role-playing and open world elements.

    Mirage is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, and Amazon Luna on October 12, 2023.
    
    Gameplay
    Assassin's Creed Mirage is an action-adventure stealth game intended to be reminiscent of older Assassin's Creed titles, being more linear and story-focused and reducing the number of role-playing elements present in recent installments of the series. The game is set principally in Baghdad, which is divided into four districts, but also features Alamut, the fortress headquarters of the Hidden Ones. Parkour, close-quarter combat, and stealth are core elements of the gameplay. For assassination missions, Mirage adopts the "Black Box" design previously seen in Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Syndicate, where players have to explore environment to find different ways to reach and eliminate their targets.[2]
    
    Similarly to previous Assassin protagonists, the main character, Basim, has a large arsenal of weapons and tools at his disposal, including the signature Assassin Hidden Blade, smoke bombs, throwing knives, and poison darts. Both weapons and tools can be upgraded through a skill tree which allows different effects to be applied to them.[3] Basim also has access to both Eagle Vision and an avial companion in the form of Enkidu (named after the character from the Epic of Gilgamesh), an Eastern imperial eagle that can be used to scout nearby areas.[4] Unlike previous Assassin's Creed games which featured avial companions, enemy archers can detect and shoot at Enkidu.[2]
    
    Some of the new features in the game include include an Assassin Focus ability that can be used during combat,[3] chain assassinations (which allow Basim to stealthily eliminate multiple enemies in quick succession), and poles that can be used to cross wide gaps around the environment.[5]
